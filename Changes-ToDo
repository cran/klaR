Changelog:
==========
- EDAM and friend added
- SVM Binaries no longer included (license)
- Examples for calc.trans(), hmm.sop() updated

- smrplot() no longer included (see below)
- EDAM (incl. all related stuff and docs) optimized

- fixes und improvements for shardsplot
- partimat: argument plot.matrix = FALSE introduced
            to allow style like a scatterplot-matrix / pairs plot;
            some related changes to get docs / other arguments

- triplot, tritrafo, quadplot, quadtrafo, centerlines added

- shardsplot: + now utilizes the whole figure region
              + bugfix in expanded shardsplots
              + new args: xlab, ylab, xaxs, yaxs
              + corrected typos in docs

- shardsplot: + Examples in EDAM() and shardsplot() fixed in resp. 
                to legend() calls
              + box() added in shardsplot()
- quadplot and friends: Minor doc fixes.

- triplot and friends added
- triplot doc fixes by KL, UL, CR, and thereafter *again* by UL.
- shardsplot, countries: Zwei keine Fehler in den Manuals geändert 

- minor changes in: tritrafo + docs, predict.svmlight, 
  quadplot docs, ucpm docs

- quadplot "fixed" and several minor doc. changes

==== release: 0.2-1 (first one on CRAN)

- quadplot arguments added and code improved to allow much more 
  fine-tuning.
- swapped order of returned arguments in predict.svmlight()

- triperplines + docs added, triplot.R + docu (examples) changed accordingly

- stepclass() can handle ucpm() measures now

- stepclass() improvement fixed. improvement is now an absolute measure that 
  works with arbitrary ucpm()s. priors have been defined for the null model.
  Defaults now to 0.05 rather than 0.95
  Explicit argument "prior" has been removed, since the implementation war crude anyway.
  *Many* cosmetic changes

- fix in ucpm(), failed if no colnames were given for the argument.

- fix in svmlight / predict.svmlight: also works now if no path is given  
- svmlight() now returns values scaled via e.scal()
- some cosmetic changes to svmlight and the help page

- fixes for rda()'s optimization code

- fixes for help files: NaiveBayes, b.scal, betascale
- cosmetic changes to correpsonding code

==== release: 0.3-0 (second one on CRAN)

- new argument legend.bg in drawparti
- some more fixes for beta scaling
- major fixes and extensions (regression, o-a-o) for svmlight
- membercheck() function introduced (checks in ucpm and betascale)
- NAMESPACE added

==== release: 0.3-2




To Do:
======

Use \concept{} in ALL Rd files.

Implementing regression tests for all major functions

stepclass:
- LATER: many rather long functions defined in stepclass() 
  should be defined in the top level of the package 
  (e.g. documenting them as "internal")
  Maybe to hide in a (forthcoming ?) Namespace?
- LATER: Rewrite it to be readable.
- allow for *arbitrary* performance measures
- allow for arbitrary predict functions

rda:
- In Main Procedure some loops within loops within ... with 
  really bad memory allocatoin as in: new <- c(new, ......) 
  e.g. lines 383 ff., the same with calls to cbind()
- LATER: rda.default() - Many functions defined therein rather 
  than in the package itself. Why?
- LATER: another optimizer, e.g. optim()?
- check whether rda == lda / qda for extreme parameter settings

quadplot: 
- rgl implementation

triplot/quadplot:
- check whether membership values are in [0,1]

EDAM:
- par(asp=1) is more appropriate than the default, isn't it?
