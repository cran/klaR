==== release: 0.2-1 (first one on CRAN)

- quadplot arguments added and code improved to allow much more
  fine-tuning.
- swapped order of returned arguments in predict.svmlight()

- triperplines + docs added, triplot.R + docu (examples) changed accordingly

- stepclass() can handle ucpm() measures now

- stepclass() improvement fixed. improvement is now an absolute measure that
  works with arbitrary ucpm()s. priors have been defined for the null model.
  Defaults now to 0.05 rather than 0.95
  Explicit argument "prior" has been removed, since the implementation war crude anyway.
  *Many* cosmetic changes

- fix in ucpm(), failed if no colnames were given for the argument.

- fix in svmlight / predict.svmlight: also works now if no path is given
- svmlight() now returns values scaled via e.scal()
- some cosmetic changes to svmlight and the help page

- NAMESPACE added

==== release: 0.3-2

- major bugfixes: *.matrix have been made NAMESPACE compatible
                  stepclass, try-catching corrected
                  predict.svmlight oao works for two classes

To Do (at least in Uwe's opinion):
======

1. disco must go into klaR and to CRAN!
   (e.g. for partimat)


stepclass:
- LATER: many rather long functions defined in stepclass()
  should be defined in the top level of the package
  (e.g. documenting them as "internal")
- LATER: Rewrite it to be readable.
- allow for *arbitrary* performance measures
- allow for arbitrary predict functions

rda:
- In Main Procedure some loops within loops within ... with
  really bad memory allocatoion as in: new <- c(new, ......)
  e.g. lines 383 ff., the same with calls to cbind()
- LATER: rda.default() - Many functions defined therein rather
  than in the package itself. Why?
- LATER: another optimizer, e.g. optim()?

quadplot:
- rgl implementation

triplot/quadplot:
- check whether membership values are in [0,1]
